Censorship rules the world! :)
==============================

*Flexible access to the list of books that allowed to import into Ukraine*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application makes easy to find whether some book passed cescorship. Of course, censorship is prohibited, but...

Technically, this spring-boot application periodically download file from censorship goverment organization, parse it
and fill internal embedded database. Employee, who fill this dabase, make a lot of mistakes in Publishers' name, Isbn, etc.
So you need to lookup carefully.

This project also shows you how to use multi-module maven project, split application into modules.
